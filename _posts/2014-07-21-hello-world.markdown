We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed - 
but also because our team are putting together 
the final missing parts to the best conference in Canada- [TBUS Conf 2017](http:/tbus.github.io/). 

This years event will take place on West Sugar island, 2 hours north of Toronto. So take your time to spend a weekend on a hidden gem in northern Ontario in the company of Canadian industry leaders.

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Topic**: more than 96 hours of awesome talks 
* **Date**: 09-11 of July
* **Venue**: West Sugar island.
* **Speakers**: 14 Canadian industry leaders

but we've already secured a first batch of experts:

* **Justin Watts** - Test Automation Lead, Loblaw Digital<br>
* **David Wolever** - CTO, Akindi<br>
* **Ted Campbell** - Sr. Developer, Mozilla<br>
* **Katie Kleemola** - Sr. Security Engineer, Ecobee<br>


More details will appear in subsequent posts.
