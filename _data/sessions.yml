  title: Python to C++ and Back Again
  description: |
    <p>
      Python and C++ may seem like mortal enemies at first, with a little bit of
      love and care they can be tricked into playing well together.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this session, Ted and David will use Python 3.6, CFFI, and Clang to put
      together a demo which canâ€™t be missed!

  description: |
    <p>
      Hard day at work? Stressed by tight deadlines? Not living up to your own
      expectations? Singer, dancer, and inspirational speaker Jamie
      "Goldierocks" Joong-Watts will spin you 'round on a whirlwind tour of

    </p>

    <p>
      Beginners and experts alike will have something to learn from this
      presentation, and we'll be starting with a through review of the basics
      (ab-spin, hip continuation flick, bracelet twist, and of course the ankle
      start) so even first-timers will have no trouble following along.

      BYOH, or borrow one of Jamie's!

  title: "Safety: the Giraffe in the Room"
  description: |
    <p>
      Every organization struggles with the health and safety of its
      resources... but how often are these steps applied only at the bottom,
      leaving those higher up the metaphorical apricot tree hanging (so to
      speak).
    </p>

    <p>
      In this talk, Ted emphasizes the importance of taking the "giraffe"
      approach to safety, where visibility and transparency are encouraged
      and monitored at every level. He gives concrete examples of threats to
      health and wellness, including physical security, long-term repetitive
      stress injuries, and changes in neurochemistry (both natural and
      artificial).
